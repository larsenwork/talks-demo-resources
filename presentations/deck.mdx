# UX programming

## Prototyping in code

<Notes>
  Before we start: We'll share a link to this presentation and any service, app,
  website etc. I mention are on the last slides. I really wanted to do a
  workshop but since we are this many I had to do a demo approach instead.

<Notes>
  Code can be a bit magic/confushing but please interupt me, ask me afterwards
  or send me a message. All code samples are shared too, obviously.

# Do I, UXer, need to code?

<Appear>

## No

## But understand when to use that skill within our teams.

</Appear>

---

# Coding, when?

<Appear>

## Most likely earlier in the process than you are doing today.

## At least if you have the freedom to explore

## To innovate

</Appear>

---

# Coding, why?

<Appear>

## Because design artefacts are:

### Limiting

### Decoupled from your data and solution

</Appear>

<Notes>
  You might have an API or Machine learning model that is already quite capable
  You might already have a rich component library
</Notes>

---

# Coding, why?

## It's often quicker

---

# Case

## Cross device picture taking flow

---

<img src="./images/ux-blueprint-1.png" />

<Notes>
  There are picture taking solutions for clinics but they are a very manual
  process and therefore rarely used. The initial solution we came up with after
  inital talks with a clinic about a pilot was this. We wanted to test this and
  couldn't do it in e.g. Figma.

# You ~~code~~ can still fake it

<Appear>

## ÷backend, ÷live dermatologist involved, ÷machine learning model, ÷production ready code

## simple camera app → ping a server → show "result" on website

</Appear>

<Notes>
  No authentication, no transfer/storing of image, so what we're left with is
</Notes>

<img src="./images/ux-blueprint-test.png" />

<Notes>
  This is slightly simplified version of what we did. It wat critical for us to
  test: how a HCP takes pictures, how it works to switch between devices, how it
  integrates with their journaling system.

# Takeaways, coding is

<Appear>

## Easy and fun!

## Not (only) the final step

## Pivotal for innovation, especially in the design+research phase
